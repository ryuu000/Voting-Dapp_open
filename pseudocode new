// Pseudocode for the voting app architecture

// Step 1: User Authentication (manual process)
Function authenticateUser(userCredentials):
    If userCredentials are valid:
        Approve user manually
        Grant access to app features
    Else:
        Deny access
        Notify user of failed authentication

// Step 2: Fetch Wellness Professionals from SQL Database
Function getWellnessProfessionals():
    Query SQL database for professional profiles
    Return list of professionals and their details

// Step 3: Voting Process
Function castVote(voter, professionalID, voteType):  // voteType is 'upvote' or 'downvote'
    If voter is authenticated:
        Trigger Hivesigner to record vote on Hive blockchain
        Log transaction details (voteType, professionalID, etc.)
        Return success or error based on blockchain response
    Else:
        Notify user to authenticate first

// Step 4: Fetch Voting Data from Hive
Function fetchVotingData(professionalID):
    Query Hive blockchain for upvotes and downvotes for the given professionalID
    Return upvotes and downvotes count

// Step 5: Manual Rewards Distribution
Function distributeRewards():
    Admin reviews Hive voting data periodically
    Fetch professionals with high net votes (upvotes - downvotes)
    Manually allocate rewards based on criteria
    Record rewards distribution in SQL database

// Step 6: Display Voting Results
Function displayProfessionalData():
    professionals = getWellnessProfessionals()
    For each professional in professionals:
        votes = fetchVotingData(professional.id)
        Display professional details along with voting data

// Step 7: User Interaction Flow
Function appFlow():
    User logs in or registers
    AuthenticateUser(userCredentials)
    If authentication is successful:
        Display list of wellness professionals
        Allow user to castVote (upvote or downvote)
        Update and display live voting results
    Else:
        End session or prompt re-authentication

// Additional Features (Optional)
Function verifyVoteIntegrity():
    Periodically check Hive blockchain transactions to prevent vote manipulation
    Flag suspicious activity for manual review

Function generateReports():
    Generate periodic reports combining SQL database and Hive voting data
    Help admins track trends and app performance
